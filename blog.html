              <p> 
                <br>
                Its a rainy day!! Perfect weather for reflection, especially
                on what is a discussion on ethics. My own ethics are rooted in sustainability 
                and doing the most good- some would say this is utilitarian, and while I agree
                to some extent, I would argue that I am not a pure utilitarian. After looking over the book,
                I would argue I am more of a rule utilitarian than anything, but more so when those rules
                pertain to protecting human life and the environment. We are very much an interconnected species
                with the environment. What we do all circles back around to the very place we live in. I do my best in my
                position to attempt to keep my actions in check with these ideals.
              
                <br><br>
    
                One student mentioned believing that if given the chance, everyone would cheat on an assignment.
                I've pondered this sentiment since he stated this. It goes along with the idea, are all people born evil?
                I do not think so. But this isnt to say that people are inherently always good, as I think good behaviors are taught. 
                But bad behaviors are also taught. We are a largely a product of the world around us. I do not cheat. I have the chance 
                to easily cheat on most assignments, but I do not. Perhaps this statement was said from a personal expierence this person had,
                but I argue that a persons good or evils is never so black and white.

          <p> 
            <br>
            HELLO! I am Blaez, greeting anyone who may have stumbled and/or purposefully clicked
            on this here blog. This is a required post for my senior seminar course,
            but who knows I might continue using this blog sometime after!!

            <br><br>
            Best experience in class?? I would have to say that would be the same
            as my worst expierence in class!! I am talking about none other than Operating Systems.
            What a lovely, interestingly indepth class, taught by Dr. Norris. The expierence I refer to
            is the Shell lab, where we had to create our own shell on a linux machine. Its a bit more
            barebones than the Systems 2 lab that some may have done, a lot less instructions on how to
            complete it. Long story short, I probably worked on that lab a good 30 hours that week. It was 
            grueling, I was so pressed for time I begged people to take my work shifts and had to ask
            my linear alegebra teacher for an extension on a project. What a fun time.

            It turned out being pretty swell though, as I was actually really proud of my shell. Everything 
            was nicely documented, and I quite enjoyed how I eloquently handled multiple problems that presented
            themselves.
            
            <br><br>

            My best out-of-class computing expierence would either be tied with my first telemetry tests for sunergy,
            or my recent hackathon at app. Long story short, the Telemetry was a project I worked on with my friend Ryan Densmore all last semester.
            We worked with XBees to send data from our schools solar car (ROSE) to the pits, which is super important for data collection during
            solar vehicle races. We hadn't told the team manager about our success, so the look on his face when observing the display at testing day
            was pure bliss. Apphack was also a really fun expierence. My team create sun.fun, which was a collection of games. Ryan and I worked on a twitch chat generator,
            except the messages were all generated from a llama model based on microphone input. During the presentation, we had twitch chat running, and it constantly
            would be commenting on what myself, ryan, nathan, or hannah would say. It was a very fun time.
