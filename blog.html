              I think the Topic I am most interested in is probably mass surveillance. A few people covered this,
              and as technology continues to advance, the topic of recognition with technology becomes more and more of
              a real and applied technology. I think recently I saw a program that used Metas AI Glasses to immedietly scan someones face,
              and pull up information on that person. That was in a consumers hand. Hense, it would be interesting to hear about
              what government has, or what corporations can do.

              Privacy Policy: I chose to look at Truist for my privacy policy, and I have to say it was about
              what I hoped. It was pretty straight forward, they were not selling my data, and seemed to behave about how 
              any rational bank should behave. Even for the iffy things, like accessing photos, they explained it was for 
              looking at checks you have submitted. I think the more interesting part of the discussion was regarding
              other companies- like META. The seemingly never ending loop of links that lead to another privacy policy makes it seem
              like they don't want to average consumer to actually understand what's happening with their data.
  
              <br><br>

              What Can You Find Assignment: Oh man I HATED this assignment. There is a concerning
              amount of information that is available about me online. It does not help that you can easily find my information
              online, probably due to my unique name. For my other group members, finding their info was pretty easy, but other
              than voter registration, there was not much available about them.

              <br><br>

              I thought the TED talk was pretty interesting, was cool to see Greenwald talk other than from the documentary about snowdin.
              I don't think I have anything to hide, but the documentary, definitely convinced me that I should be concerned about my own privacy.

            <h1 class = 'title is-5 has-text-white'> Reflection on Citizen Four </h1>
            <h2 class = 'subtitle has-text-white'> November 30th, 2025 (due October 15 :[ ) </h2>
  
            <p> 
              <br>

              Citizen Four was a pretty interesting documentary. Snowdin clearly approached the expose of the classified matieral with great care, approaching trustworthy
              media, encrypting messages, and commuting to a location in which he could not be immediately persecuted. The documentary was especially well created, it gave an unadultered
              way to observe what he did from his own eyes. He acted in not his own interest, but in the interest of what he thought was ethically sound. He clearly did not
              want the attention, but rather did not want anyone else to get blamed for his actions. I think that is kind of heroic.              

              <br><br>
              
             I will say, I think it is crazy he didn't tell his immediate girlfriend at all what was going on. I mean,
             there is a chance he did, and he simply left it out of his conversations with the media to 
             ensure she wouldn't be prosecuted, but If I were about to make that decision, I would have told my partner.

              <br><br>
              My biggest takeaway is that, sadly, very little has happened that actually protects the privacy of citizens. If anything,
              it has worsened, with the advent of AI, better facial regulation, and deregulation.

                By far the most interesting thing I have learned has to be about the Bees themselves and the entire economy of the bee community.
                Yes, this has less to do with hivetracks itself, but I think the whole community is the most interesting thing to me.
                The bee convention/meetup that Dr. Wilkes is visiting this following week. The Flow Beehive and the absolute success of that 
                company was cool to hear about. 

                <br><br>
                
                I guess hearing about the mites present on the bees, and the persistance of the pests and elimination of them through pesticides was something interesting.
                Its crazy that I have never heard of this, even though I buy so much honey in my freetime. The HiveTracks app and its reccomendations for mite pesticide spraying
                is a helpful tool!! 

                <br><br>

                The last interesting thing has to be the laws requiring a public showcase of beehives in certain states was super interesting. Really crazy to see
                the amount of beehives in certain states! Puts in perspective the shear amount of bees that surround us!!!

                Its a rainy day!! Also silksong eve. Perfect weather for reflection, especially
                on what is a discussion on ethics. My own ethics are rooted in sustainability 
                and doing the most good- some would say this is utilitarian, and while I agree
                to some extent, I would argue that I am not a pure utilitarian. After looking over the book,
                I would argue I am more of a rule utilitarian than anything, but more so when those rules
                pertain to protecting human life and the environment. We are very much an interconnected species
                with the environment. What we do all circles back around to the very place we live in. I do my best in my
                position to attempt to keep my actions in check with these ideals.
              
                <br><br>
    
                One student mentioned believing that if given the chance, everyone would cheat on an assignment.
                I've pondered this sentiment since he stated this. It goes along with the idea, are all people born evil?
                I do not think so. But this isnt to say that people are inherently always good, as I think good behaviors are taught. 
                But bad behaviors are also taught. We are a largely a product of the world around us. I do not cheat. I have the chance 
                to easily cheat on most assignments, but I do not. Perhaps this statement was said from a personal expierence this person had,
                but I argue that a persons good or evils is never so black and white.

          <p> 
            <br>
            HELLO! I am Blaez, greeting anyone who may have stumbled and/or purposefully clicked
            on this here blog. This is a required post for my senior seminar course,
            but who knows I might continue using this blog sometime after!!

            <br><br>
            Best experience in class?? I would have to say that would be the same
            as my worst expierence in class!! I am talking about none other than Operating Systems.
            What a lovely, interestingly indepth class, taught by Dr. Norris. The expierence I refer to
            is the Shell lab, where we had to create our own shell on a linux machine. Its a bit more
            barebones than the Systems 2 lab that some may have done, a lot less instructions on how to
            complete it. Long story short, I probably worked on that lab a good 30 hours that week. It was 
            grueling, I was so pressed for time I begged people to take my work shifts and had to ask
            my linear alegebra teacher for an extension on a project. What a fun time.

            It turned out being pretty swell though, as I was actually really proud of my shell. Everything 
            was nicely documented, and I quite enjoyed how I eloquently handled multiple problems that presented
            themselves.
            
            <br><br>

            My best out-of-class computing expierence would either be tied with my first telemetry tests for sunergy,
            or my recent hackathon at app. Long story short, the Telemetry was a project I worked on with my friend Ryan Densmore all last semester.
            We worked with XBees to send data from our schools solar car (ROSE) to the pits, which is super important for data collection during
            solar vehicle races. We hadn't told the team manager about our success, so the look on his face when observing the display at testing day
            was pure bliss. Apphack was also a really fun expierence. My team create sun.fun, which was a collection of games. Ryan and I worked on a twitch chat generator,
            except the messages were all generated from a llama model based on microphone input. During the presentation, we had twitch chat running, and it constantly
            would be commenting on what myself, ryan, nathan, or hannah would say. It was a very fun time.
